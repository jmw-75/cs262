CS 262 - Lab #8

This lab is based on: https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/08is/lab.html

I used a pre-created SQL file and added both single-table and multiple-table
queries to return information from a Monopoly themed database

Questions:
    The answers to the questions can be found at the bottom of the file 'spj-queries.sql' parts c and d.

CS 262 - Lab #2

This lab is based on https://github.com/kvlinden-courses/cs262-code.git

What I did: Working through some technical exercises, in this case on project management tools.
	    Conducting a project management meeting with your (new) teammates and with us, in this case to do a preliminary visioning session for our team project. Weâ€™ll pull each team out of the session into SB 321a for a team meeting based on a rotating schedule.

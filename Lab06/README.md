CS 262 - Lab #6

This lab is based on: https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/06hci/lab.html

I used React Native's Networking tutorial to display some data from a booklist generated by the URL given
Answers to the lab questions:

1. What do the hooks in this code do?
	Hooks are functions that let you hook into React state and lifecycle features from function components.
	In the code,the hook, useEffect, adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component. 

2. Modify the URL to some invalid value and explain how the code responds.
	if the URL has extra things added to the end, the data gets changed, but the code
	still outputs. If anything is changed before that, the output is blank with nothing on
	the screen. it does not cause it to crash but nothing is outputted.
